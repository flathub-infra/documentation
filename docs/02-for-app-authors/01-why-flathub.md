# Why Flathub?

## What Flathub offers

Flathub is a centralized repository for Flatpak apps, providing a
unified and reliable platform for distributing applications across the
most popular Linux distributions. With a growing user base, some Linux
distributions enable Flathub by default, while others offer a simple
setup process.

Flathub simplifies app submission, maintenance, and updates, making it
easy for developers to distribute and manage their applications. Once an
app is published on Flathub, users can conveniently install it via
graphical software centers or the Flatpak command line.

Furthermore, Flathub enhances app visibility through promotions on its
official website and social media channels, helping developers connect
with a wider audience.
