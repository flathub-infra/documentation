# Why Flathub?

## What Flathub offers

Flathub is a centralized repository of Flatpak apps. It provides a single point of entry for distributing apps on the most popular Linux distributions. It has a growing number of users, with some Linux distributions enabling it by default, and simple setup steps for those that don’t.

Once an app is included in Flathub, it can be easily installed by users, either using a graphical software center or the flatpak command line. It is also possible to provide a link that will open the app in a software center.

Flathub also provides a means for app updates to be distributed to users—once an app is included, its developers can make new releases which will be automatically distributed to users.

Finally, Flathub can help with exposure for applications, through software centers where available apps are advertised, and through our own websites and social media channels.

## Who can use Flathub

Flathub is primarily intended for use by developers who want to distribute desktop apps on Linux. Apps must either be redistributable or be available as a third party download.

If you are responsible for a commercial app that you would like to distribute through Flathub, you are also welcome to submit it through this process, provided that the following requirements are met:

- The app is permitted to be redistributed by Flathub and other third parties (mirrors, CDN, hardware donors, etc)
- The project license is correctly referenced in the metadata in the [appstream project_license tag](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-project_license)

Note that at present, we have no mechanism to process payments for app publishers. In-app purchases, subscriptions or upgrades are acceptable provided that the [OARS metadata](https://hughsie.github.io/oars/generate.html#money) correctly reflects that such purchases are available.

If you have any other queries about publishing a commercial app, we’d love to speak to you and would encourage you to [contact the Flathub admins](mailto:admins@flathub.org).
