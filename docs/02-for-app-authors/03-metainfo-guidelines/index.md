# MetaInfo guidelines

These are a set of guidelines for MetaInfo that should be followed for submission on Flathub.

:::tip
Please check the [Quality Guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines)
page too, to make your application metadata more presentable.
:::

:::note
Please consult the [official AppStream documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html) for more in-depth info.
:::

## Validation

All MetaInfo files included in build must pass validation using the
[linter](/docs/for-app-authors/linter) which can also validate the
MetaInfo file. Install `org.flatpak.Builder` from Flathub:

```sh
flatpak install -y flathub org.flatpak.Builder
```
Then the MetaInfo file validation can be performed with:

```sh
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder appstream %{id}.metainfo.xml
```

This runs `appstreamcli validate` from the [AppStream project](https://github.com/ximion/appstream/)
with some Flathub specific checks integrated into it.

Both errors and warnings are considered to be fatal by `appstreamcli`
and needs to be resolved.

### Appstream Validation Errors

:::note
A full list of error codes and explanations can also be found online in
the [data validation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Validation.html#validator-issues-list)
page.
:::

Flathub increases the severity of the following Appstream checks
to `error`: `all-categories-ignored, category-invalid, cid-desktopapp-is-not-rdns, cid-has-number-prefix, cid-missing-affiliation-gnome, cid-rdns-contains-hyphen, content-rating-missing, desktop-app-launchable-omitted, desktop-file-not-found, invalid-child-tag-name, metainfo-filename-cid-mismatch, metainfo-legacy-path, metainfo-legacy-path, name-has-dot-suffix, releases-info-missing, unknown-tag`
and decreases the severity of the following to not cause an error:
`cid-domain-not-lowercase, component-name-too-long, description-has-plaintext-url, developer-id-invalid, component-name-too-long, summary-too-long`

Explanations for Appstream errors are provided below.

#### custom-key-duplicated

A `custom` tag with same `key` attribute is used twice. It must be used once.

#### type-property-required

The corresponding tag requires a `type` attribute. Please see the [MetaInfo guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines) for the tag.

#### metainfo-localized-description-tag

The MetaInfo file has translated the `description` tag itself. Please see the [translation section](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#metainfo-translations) on how to use translation attributes.

#### circular-component-relation

The `extends`, `provides`, `requires` or `recommends` tag in the MetaInfo file references the application's own ID.

#### mimetypes-tag-deprecated

The `mimetype` tag is deprecated in favour of a `mediatypes` child tag under the `provides` tag. Please see the specification on how to use it.

#### custom-invalid-tag

One of the `custom` tags in the [MetaInfo file](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#path-and-filename) does not have the `value` child tag. Custom tags can have only `value` as child tags.

## Path and filename

:::note
`/app/share/appdata` and `%{id}.appdata.xml` are considered to be the legacy path and filename, respectively.
:::

Place the MetaInfo file into `/app/share/metainfo/`, name it `%{id}.metainfo.xml`, where `%{id}` is the [ID](#id).
This ID and the filename must match exactly with the `id` set in the
[Flatpak manifest](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html).

## MetaInfo generator

:::note
Please check the generated output and add any mandatory or recommended tags mentioned below.
:::

The [AppStream MetaInfo Creator](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/metainfocreator/)
tool can be used to generate a basic file.

## Header

All MetaInfo files must start with:

```xml title="tld.vendor.appid.metainfo.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Copyright [year] [name] -->
<component type="desktop-application">
```

`type="desktop-application"` is for graphical desktop applications.
Console applications must use `type="console-application"` and extensions
must use `type="addon"`. SDK extensions or runtimes can use
`type="runtime"`.

## ID

The ID must be exactly the same as the [Application-ID](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id):

```xml
<!-- Good -->
<id>org.flatpak.qtdemo</id>

<!-- Bad -->
<id>org.flatpak.qtdemo.desktop</id>
<id>qtdemo.desktop</id>

<!-- Incorrect -->
<id>qtdemo</id>
```

### Renaming ID tag

:::note
The ID tag must exactly match the Flatpak ID. If it has to be renamed
completely, the application needs to be [resubmitted](/docs/for-app-authors/maintenance#renaming-the-flatpak-id).
:::

The [ID tag](#id) in the [MetaInfo file](#path-and-filename) is supposed
to be a constant and unique identifier of an application and should not
be renamed unless absolutely necessary.

If a rename is necessary, please add the old [ID tag](#id) as a
[provides tag](#provides) and a [replaces tag](#replaces) in the
[MetaInfo file](#path-and-filename).

`rename-appdata-file` in the Flatpak manifest can automatically update
the [ID tag](#id) in the [MetaInfo file](#path-and-filename) and add the
old ID to the [provides tag](#provides).

## License

All MetaInfo must have a [metadata license tag](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-metadata_license)
that is the license of the MetaInfo file itself.

If application metadata has not been provided by the upstream, it should be licensed with [FSFAP](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html) or [Creative Commons Zero, version 1](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/).
Please see the [specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-metadata_license)
for other recommended licenses.

```xml
<metadata_license>CC0-1.0</metadata_license>
```

Followed by a mandatory `project_license` tag:

```xml
<project_license>GPL-3.0-only</project_license>
```

The value must be a valid [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). License [expression operators](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-expressions/#d4-composite-license-expressions) like `AND, OR, WITH` are supported.

Proprietary applications/custom licenses can use `LicenseRef-proprietary`
with a link to the license:

```xml
<project_license>LicenseRef-proprietary=https://example.org/legal/</project_license>
```

## Name and summary

:::note

Name and summary should not violate any trademarks.

:::

```xml
<name>App Name</name>
<summary>Short summary</summary>
```

Please make sure to follow the quality guidelines for [name](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines#app-name)
and [summary](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines#summary).

## Developer Name

A `developer` [tag](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-developer)
with an `id` attribute and a `name` child tag must be present. The `name`
must be the author or developer of the application.

The `id` must be a reverse DNS, for example `org.example`.

Only one `developer` tag and only one child `name` tag in
[untranslated](#metainfo-translations) form is allowed.

```xml
<developer id="org.example">
  <name>Developer name</name>
</developer>
```

Please see the [translations section](#metainfo-translations) to
translate these tags.

## Description

A short and informative description must be present.

Only the following child tags are supported: `p` (paragraph), `ol, ul`
(ordered and unordered list) with `li` (list items) child tags, `em` for
italicized emphasis and `code` for inline code in monospace.

The description must have at least one non empty `p`, `ol` or `ul` tag.
It must not contain any direct URLs.

```xml
<description>
  <p>Some <em>description</em></p>
  <p>Some <code>description</code></p>
  <p>A list of features</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feature 1</li>
    <li>Feature 2</li>
    <li>Feature 3</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The app can do:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Feature 1</li>
    <li>Feature 2</li>
    <li>Feature 3</li>
  </ol>
</description>
```

Please see the [translations section](#metainfo-translations) to
translate these tags.

## Launchable

All graphical applications having a desktop file must have this tag in
the MetaInfo. If this is present, `appstreamcli compose` will pull
icons, keywords and categories from the desktop file.

The value must correspond to an installed desktop file and adhere to the
permitted [exportable patterns](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#desktop-files).
Multiple launchable tags must not be used.

```xml
<launchable type="desktop-id">org.flatpak.qtdemo.desktop</launchable>
```

If `rename-desktop-file` is used in the manifest, this tag will also
be renamed.

Console applications having no desktop file can use the `provides` tag
described below.

## Provides

This can be used to link to other instances of the application using a
different ID. It also prevents ODRS reviews to be “lost” on a rename.

:::note

The old desktop file name is automatically added if we use `rename-desktop-file` in the Flatpak manifest.

:::

```xml
<provides>
  <id>qtdemo.desktop</id>
</provides>
```

Console applications must add their main binary name to the provides tag:

```xml
<provides>
  <binary>foo</binary>
</provides>
```

Please see the [specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-provides)
to know more.

## Replaces

In general renaming the application ID should be avoided, but if it was
renamed at some point, this tag can be used to indicate that the
application in current `id` tag replaces the one in this tag.

```xml
<id>org.example.current-app</id>
  [...]
  <replaces>
    <id>org.example.old-app</id>
  </replaces>
```

## Categories and keywords


If there’s a [launchable](#launchable) defined for a desktop application,
categories and keywords are pulled from the desktop file. Defining them
separately in the Metainfo file will override the contents of the
desktop file.

Please don't use, generic categories like
`GTK, Qt, KDE, GNOME, Motif, Java, GUI, Application, XFCE, DDE` as these
are filtered by Appstream. These can be placed in `Keywords` if
necessary. Please see the [Menu specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html)
for a list of valid category names.

Console applications with no desktop file can define them in the Metainfo
file.

```xml
<categories>
  <category>Development</category>
  <category>Science</category>
</categories>

<keywords>
  <keyword>IDE</keyword>
  <keyword>development</keyword>
</keywords>
```

## Icons

:::note

Icons must not violate any trademark, be a copy of another application's
icon or be confusingly similar.

:::

All desktop applications must install icons of the [required size](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#icons)
to the [proper location](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-icons)
and must also have a [launchable](#launchable) entry so that  `appstreamcli compose`
can fetch the icon from the desktop file.

Console applications wanting to appear in Flathub website search results
must also provide icons.

Console applications wanting to set icons for application stores, can
also [install icons](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-icons).
If icons are installed an `icon` tag with `type=stock` can be used. The
value must be the filename of the icon (usually the `$FLATPAK_ID`) and
must not contain the extension suffix.

If console applications do not install an icon, an `icon` tag with
`type=remote` can be used with the tag value being a direct HTTP(S)
link to an icon.

```xml
<icon type="stock">org.flatpak.qtdemo</icon>
<icon type="remote">https://example.org/icon.png</icon>
```

Please see the [quality guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines#app-icon)
for icons too.

## Project Group

The `<project_group/>` tag can be used if the application is affiliated
with a known software project like for example GNOME, KDE or Mozilla.

The following project group tag values `Freedesktop, FreeDesktop, GNOME, KDE`
are  "protected", meaning only application IDs starting with
`org.freedesktop, org.gnome, org.kde` respectively are allowed to use
them.

These IDs are only allowed for official applications from respective
project groups.

```xml
<project_group>GNOME</project_group>
```

## Brand color

Applications should set a [brand color](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-branding)
in both light and dark variants like so:

```xml
<branding>
  <color type="primary" scheme_preference="light">#ff00ff</color>
  <color type="primary" scheme_preference="dark">#993d3d</color>
</branding>
```

This is used by Flathub and native app store clients on banners, app
pages, etc.

Brand color and app banners can be previewed at https://docs.flathub.org/banner-preview/

## Open Age Ratings Service (OARS)

Use the [OARS website](https://hughsie.github.io/oars/generate.html) to
generate age rating information for your application. Make sure to use `type="oars-1.1"`.

Applications must be properly tagged by OARS data based on their content.

```xml
<content_rating type="oars-1.1" />
```

## URL

At minimum `url type="homepage"` tag must be present to pass validation
but it is best to include other links too.

```xml
<url type="bugtracker">https://example.org/issues</url>
<url type="homepage">https://example.org/</url>
<url type="donation">https://example.org/donate</url>
<url type="contact">https://example.org/contact</url>
<url type="faq">https://example.org/faq</url>
<url type="translate">https://example.org/translate</url>
<url type="contribute">https://example.org/contribute</url>
<url type="vcs-browser">https://example.org/repository</url>
```

Including the `url type="vcs-browser"` tag for open-source projects
to display the source code repository is highly recommended.

## Screenshots

All graphical applications must have one or more screenshots in the
MetaInfo. Please make sure to follow the [quality guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines#screenshots)
for screenshots.

Console applications wanting to appear in Flathub website search results
must provide screenshots.

The link inside `image` tag must be a direct link to a image resource on
the web. If the images are hosted in a git repository, the
link should be from a tag or a commit and not a branch.

It should look something like this:

```xml
<screenshots>
  <screenshot type="default">
    <image>https://example.org/example1.png</image>
    <caption>A caption</caption>
  </screenshot>
  <screenshot>
    <image>https://example.org/example2.png</image>
    <caption>A caption</caption>
  </screenshot>
</screenshots>
```

Please see the [translations section](#metainfo-translations) to
translate these tags.

## Release

Applications must supply a releases tag in their MetaInfo to pass
validation. Please make sure to also follow the [quality guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/quality-guidelines#release-notes)
while writing release notes.

The description tag follows the same formatting as the toplevel
[description tag](#description). Flathub supports showing a detailed
release note link when `<url type="details">` tag is used. Release dates
must not be in the future and versions must be [properly ordered](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-AppStream-Misc.html#spec-vercmp-recommendations).

:::tip
`appstreamcli vercmp <version 1> <version 2>` can be used to compare the
order of two versions.
:::


Releases in MetaInfo should look like this:

```xml
<releases>
  <release version="1.0.1" date="2024-01-18">
    <url type="details">https://example.org/changelog.html#version_1.0.1</url>
    <description>
      <p>Release description</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List of changes</li>
          <li>List of changes</li>
        </ul>
    </description>
  </release>
  <release version="1.0.0" date="2023-08-07">
    <url type="details">https://example.org/changelog.html#version_1.0.0</url>
    <description>
      <p>Release description</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List of changes</li>
          <li>List of changes</li>
        </ul>
    </description>
  </release>
</releases>
```

## Translations

Appstream provides translation information, so that software centers can inform users if the app is translated into their language. If the app uses Mozilla `.xpi` or Google `.pak` files for translation, the translation info is populated automatically. If the app uses gettext `.mo` or Qt `.qm` files, you’ll need to provide the prefix of these files with a `<translation/>` tag:

```xml
<translation type="gettext">gnome-builder</translation>
<translation type="qt">qtdemo</translation>
```

You can specify this tag multiple times if needed.

Please note that the `appstreamcli compose` expects the translations at:

- For `gettext` it’s `${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/<id>.mo` where `id` is the value in the translation tag.
- For `qt` if the `id` string has slashes it's either `${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/<id>_<lang>.qm` or `${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/<id>/<lang>.qm`. If the `id` string has no slashes it's
  `${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/<id>.qm` where `id` is the value in the translation tag.

To see if it was detected correctly, check the [generated output](#checking-the-generated-output).

## MetaInfo translations

:::note
English tag values must not use the `xml:lang` property. A tag value
without `xml:lang` must be present.
:::

Various tags in MetaInfo support translations using the `xml:lang="<lang>"`
property.

The following tags can have translations: `name`, `name` child tag in
`developer`, `summary`, `keywords`, `image`, `caption` and `description`.

The `description` tag has to be translated by each `<p>` and `<li>` tags.

```xml
<name>App name</name>
<name xml:lang="de">Translated App name</name>

<summary>A summary</summary>
<summary xml:lang="de">Translated summary</summary>

<developer id="org.example">
  <name>Developer name</name>
  <name xml:lang="de">Translated developer name</name>
</developer>

<description>
  <p>Some description</p>
  <p xml:lang="de">Translated description</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A list</li>
    <li xml:lang="de">Translated list</li>
  </ul>
</description>

<screenshots>
  <screenshot type="default">
    <image>https://example.org/example1.png</image>
    <image xml:lang="de">https://example.org/example1_de.png</image>
    <caption>A caption</caption>
    <caption xml:lang="de">Translated caption</caption>
  </screenshot>
</screenshots>

<keywords>
  <keyword>Keyword</keyword>
  <keyword xml:lang="de">Translated keyword</keyword>
</keywords>
```

By default elements in MetaInfo that can be translatable will be marked
as such. However `translate="no"` can be used to explicitly mark them
as forbidden. The whole block of the `description` tag can be excluded
by using `translate="no"`.

```xml
<developer id="org.example">
  <name translate="no">Developer name</name>
</developer>
```

## Device support

:::tip
```bash
appstreamcli check-syscompat --details $FLATPAK_ID.metainfo.xml
```
can be used to get an overview of the compatibility.
:::

Device or hardware support metadata describes what kinds of input and
output devices an app supports.

The `requires` tag denotes an absolute requirement on the property
while the `recommends` and `supports` tag is a recommendation. Each of
these parent tags must be present at most once in the metainfo but
the child tags can be repeated inside them.

Software stores can use this information to categorise apps and show
device support information to the user.

### Control

The below metadata will indicate that the app supports both desktop and
touch (mobile and tablet) devices.

```xml
<!-- Desktop AND mobile supported -->
<recommends>
  <control>keyboard</control>
  <control>pointing</control>
  <control>touch</control>
</recommends>
```

The below metadata will indicate that the app supports only desktop
devices.

```xml
<!-- ONLY desktop supported -->
<requires>
  <control>keyboard</control>
  <control>pointing</control>
</requires>
```

The below metadata will indicate that the app supports only touch
(mobile and tablet) devices.

```xml
<!-- ONLY touch supported -->
<requires>
  <control>touch</control>
</requires>
```

Additionally, `tablet`, `gamepad`, and [other properties](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-relations-control)
are available as well. For example, if an app has a mandatory requirement
on gamepad, it should use

```xml
<requires>
  <control>gamepad</control>
</requires>
```

but if it supports gamepad along with other inputs like keyboard and
mouse, it should instead use

```xml
<recommends>
  <control>keyboard</control>
  <control>pointing</control>
  <control>gamepad</control>
</recommends>
```

### Display size

This can be used to indicate support for a specific display size(s). The
tag value must be a positive integer, measured in logical pixels.

The `compare` attribute is usually used with `ge` which
means `greater than or equals to`. If `compare` is not specified
`ge` is used implicitly. The `side` attribute is usually used with
`shortest` and if it is not specified, `shortest` is assumed implicitly.

The specific value used in the tag should be a realistic measurement of
the minimum size that the app can scale to without harming functionality.
Software stores may use specific values or ranges to classify an app
into mobile, tablet or desktop compatible app.

A value of `<=360` with the `ge` relation indicates that the
app supports mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Usually `360` is used
as a baseline here.

```xml
<requires>
  <!-- Mobile/tablet AND desktop supported -->
  <display_length compare="ge">360</display_length>
</requires>
```

A value of `>=361` with the `ge` relation indicates that
the app supports only desktop devices. Usually `768` is used as a
baseline here.

```xml
<requires>
  <!-- ONLY desktop supported -->
  <display_length compare="ge">768</display_length>
</requires>
```

A value of `>=768` and `<=1279` with the `le` relation indicates that
the app supports only mobile and tablet devices. Usually `1279` is used
as a baseline here.

```xml
<requires>
  <!-- ONLY mobile/tablet supported -->
  <display_length compare="le">1279</display_length>
</requires>
```

### Desktop only apps

Desktop only apps typically should have:

```xml
<requires>
  <control>keyboard</control>
  <control>pointing</control>
  <display_length compare="ge">768</display_length>
</requires>
```

### Mobile only apps

Mobile and tablet only apps typically should have:


```xml
<requires>
  <control>touch</control>
  <display_length compare="le">1279</display_length>
</requires>
```

### Desktop and mobile apps

Apps that support and work on mobile, tablet and desktop typically
should have:


```xml
<recommends>
  <control>keyboard</control>
  <control>pointing</control>
  <control>touch</control>
</recommends>
<requires>
  <display_length compare="ge">360</display_length>
</requires>
```

### Mobile collection

An app is eligible to appear in the [Flathub store mobile collection](https://flathub.org/apps/collection/mobile/1)
if it has the above tags with values that support mobile and tablets.
It must also have an icon. The collection is sorted in descending
order based on trending.

## Manifest location

Applications that are directly uploaded to Flathub through their own
infrastructure and does not have a Github repo on the [Flathub
organisation](https://github.com/flathub) must add the location to their
flatpak manifest like so:

```xml
<custom>
  <value key="flathub::manifest">https://example.com/url_with_a_git_hash/com.example.my-app.json</value>
</custom>
```

## Extensions

Extensions need to follow only some of the guidelines outlined above. All extensions should include a MetaInfo file
and all application extensions must use the `extends` tag.

An example of a MetaInfo file for extension is provided in the [Flatpak documentation](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/extension.html#extension-manifest).

## Preview

The MetaInfo file can be previewed using [GNOME Software](https://apps.gnome.org/Software/)
either by installing the Flatpak package from the test build or locally.

Note that test builds done from Flathub infrastructure will be missing
screenshots.

GNOME Software also has a flag to preview the MetaInfo file:
`gnome-software --show-metainfo /path/to/$FLATPAK_ID.metainfo.xml`.

Appstreamcli also offers a way to preview on the command line using
`appstreamcli get --details --datapath /path/to/$FLATPAK_ID.metainfo.xml $ID`
or `appstreamcli get --details $ID` when the catalogue data is installed
locally to the appstream cache (usually this means the Flatpak package is
installed).

## Checking the generated output

Once an app has been built with a proper MetaInfo file, Flatpak Builder
automatically invokes `appstreamcli compose` from the [AppStream Project](https://github.com/ximion/appstream/)
that composes the application metadata gathered from the desktop file,
icon and the MetaInfo file into a combined XML file called the
[AppStream Catalog data](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-CatalogData.html#sect-AppStream-XML).

This file must not be manually created or modified. The file can be found
in `<builddir>/files/share/app-info/xmls/<app-id>.xml.gz` or
`${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/app-info/xmls/<app-id>.xml.gz` inside the sandbox.

The compose process also creates icons in `<builddir>/files/share/app-info/icons/flatpak/{64x64, 128x128}/<app-id>.png`
provided a PNG icon of size 64px or more, or a SVG icon was installed
to the [proper location](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-icons)
during the build.

Flatpak then combines catalog data for each application into a combined
AppStream catalog file for a repository. Software stores like Flathub,
GNOME Software, KDE Discover and even Flatpak CLI reads this combined
AppStream catalog file of a repository to display information about an
application. So it is essential that this file contains no errors which
by extension means that the MetaInfo file, icon and the desktop file
passes all validation.
