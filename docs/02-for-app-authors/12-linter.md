# Flatpak builder lint

The Flatpak builder lint tool is a linter for Flatpak manifests. It's used to check for common errors, to enforce a consistent style and permissions.
It can be found in the [flatpak-builder-lint](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint) repository.

Please follow [installation instructions](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint#flatpak) to install and run locally.

It's run against all builds sent to Flathub, and can be run locally to check your manifest before submitting it. You can find more information in the readme.

[^1]: Unless the package existed before the linter.
[^2]: Unless BaseApps or extensions. (Might also be granted on a case-by-case basis)
[^3]: Granted for `extra-data`.
[^4]: Exception only for tools that requires D-Bus access and for which the names are not predictable; this includes D-Bus tools and IDEs. In general it isn't allowed.
[^5]: Only for console applications, graphical applications must have finish-args.

## Exceptions

Linter errors can be ignored with exceptions. Exceptions are granted on a case-by-case basis, and it's not because you see a package with an exception that your exception will be granted. Some are grandfathered as their existence predates the linter. The exception pull request needs to be merged for a package submission to be buildable.

To apply for an exception, you need to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint/pulls) for the JSON [exception file](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint/blob/master/flatpak_builder_lint/staticfiles/exceptions.json). The syntax is:

```json
"my.app.id": {
    "linter-error": "reason for the exception"
}
```

There should be only one entry for the application, but it can contain multiple exceptions. Please make sure the reason is explanatory.
