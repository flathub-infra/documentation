# Flatpak builder lint

Flatpak builder lint is a linter for Flatpak manifests and builds. It is
primarily developed for Flathub, but can be useful for other Flatpak
repositories as well.

Please follow [installation instructions](https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint?tab=readme-ov-file#flatpak)
to install and run it locally.

The `manifest` check and the `repo` check is run against all builds
on Flathub, and can also be run locally.

```bash
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest <manifest>
```

The `repo` check below expects an OSTree repository in the current path
called `repo`. This is generated when
[building the manifest with Flatpak Builder](/docs/for-app-authors/submission#build-and-install)
and passing the `--repo=repo` argument.

```bash
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder repo repo
```

You can find more information in the [project readme](https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/blob/master/README.md).

## Exceptions

Linter errors can be ignored with exceptions. Exceptions are granted on
a case-by-case basis and the exception pull request needs to be merged
first. Once merged it usually takes a couple of hours to be available.

To apply for an exception, you need to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint/pulls) for the JSON [exception file](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint/blob/master/flatpak_builder_lint/staticfiles/exceptions.json). The syntax is:

```json
"my.app.id": {
    "linter-error": "reason for the exception"
}
```

There should be only one entry for the application, but it can contain
multiple exceptions. Please make sure the reason is explanatory.

### Check currently published exceptions

You can check the current set of published exceptions for an application
with:

```bash
curl -s https://flathub.org/api/v2/exceptions|jq '."my.app.id"'
```

## Linter errors

Here is a list of linter errors, and whether exceptions may be applied, by default.

### appid-length-more-than-255-chars

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The length of appid string is more than 255 characters.

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appid-less-than-3-components

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The appid has less than 3 components after splitting at each `.`. At
least 3 components is needed.

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appid-component-wrong-syntax

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The appid contains a disallowed character.

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appid-too-many-components-for-app

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The appid has >=6 components after splitting at each `.`. Applications
must try to have at most 6 components.

This is not checked for runtimes or baseapps.

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appid-url-check-internal-error

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The URL could not be determined from the appid. This is an internal
error for the linter.

### appid-url-not-reachable

**Exceptions allowed**: Yes, on a case-by-case basis

The URL determined from the domain portion of the appid was not
reachable.

Please see the [Control over domain or repository](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#control-over-domain-or-repository)
section for more information.

### appid-code-hosting-too-few-components

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The app id uses a code hosting domain like GitLab, GitHub or Codeberg
and doesn't have 4 components: `{tld}.{doamin}.foo.bar`.

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appid-ends-with-lowercase-desktop

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The app id ends with lowercase `.desktop`.

Please follow the [Flatpak documentation](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-ids)
for more information.

### appid-filename-mismatch

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The filename of the [Flatpak manifest](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html)
does not match the app id used in the manifest.

### appid-not-defined

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The app id (`id` or `app-id`) is not defined in the [Flatpak manifest](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html).

### appid-uses-code-hosting-domain

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The app id uses a code hosting domain like GitLab, GitHub or Codeberg
and the first `{tld}` component does not start with `io` for GitHub

Please follow the [app id guidelines](/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#application-id)
for more information.

### appstream-external-screenshot-url

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The screenshots in [AppStream catalog](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#checking-the-generated-output)
aren't mirrored to https://dl.flathub.org/media.

[Flatpak Builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html)
invokes `appstreamcli compose` for mirroring when `--mirror-screenshots-url=URL`
is passed.

This can happen when mirroring fails due to spurious connectivity issues
and is usually resolved by restarting the build.

Externally uploaded apps must ensure `--mirror-screenshots-url=URL`
was passed to Flatpak Builder.

### appstream-failed-validation

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The [MetaInfo file](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#path-and-filename)
has failed validation. The output from the validation is in the `appstream`
block.

AppStream considers both warnings (`W`) and errors (`E`) as fatal
and they must be resolved.

Please use the [linter](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#validation)
to validate the [MetaInfo file](/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#path-and-filename)
and fix the issues reported.

### appstream-screenshots-not-mirrored-in-ostree

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The ostree ref is missing a `screenshots/{arch}` ref.

This error should not be reached on Flathub and can be ignored if an
app submission is targetting Flathub.

Externally uploaded apps must ensure to [mirror screenshots](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html), commit the screenshot ref and upload the screenshot ref for all
architectures.

Committing is done after [Flatpak Builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html)
exported a repo, using `ostree commit --repo=<repo name> --canonical-permissions
--branch=screenshots/<arch> <builddir>/files/share/app-info/media`.

The [finish-args](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html#finishing)
in the manifest has a filesystem permission that starts with
`/home` or `/var/home`.

Flatpak cannot access anything in `/home` and `/home/username` becomes
dependent on the username.

`--filesystem=~/foo`, `--filesystem=home`, `--filesystem=home/foo` should
be used instead.

Please consult the [Flatpak permission guide](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html)

### no-exportable-icon-installed

**Exceptions allowed**: No

This means that no exportable icons were found in the [proper location](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-icons).

An icon is considered by Flatpak to be exportable if it matches any of
the following patterns: `$FLATPAK_ID, $FLATPAK_ID-foo, $FLATPAK_ID.foo`.

They may end with extension suffixes like `.png`, `.svg` or `.svgz`.

### non-svg-icon-in-scalable-folder

**Exceptions allowed**: No

An icon file with an extension other than `.svg, .svgz` was installed to
`$FLATPAK_DEST/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps` (`builddir/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps`
for the local build directory).

The scalable folder is only reserved for SVG icons.

### non-png-icon-in-hicolor-size-folder

**Exceptions allowed**: No

An icon file with an extension other than `.png` was installed to

is a path.

This must be just the name of the main binary of the application and the
binary must be present in `$FLATPAK_DEST/bin`.

### toplevel-unnecessary-branch

**Exceptions allowed**: No

The toplevel `branch` or `default-branch` property in the
[Flatpak manifest](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html)
is unnecessary.

On Flathub, the branch is set by the builder using `--default-branch`
argument of [Flatpak Builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html).

Specifying the branch or default-branch property leads to other issues.

## Linter warnings

Warnings are non-fatal but they should be resolved, if possible. Some of
them might be promoted to an error in the future if needed.
