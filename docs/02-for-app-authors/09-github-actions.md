Actions:

## Using GitHub actions on your Flathub repository

:::note
Please note that any custom GitHub actions that commits or pushes to PRs
or branches should be run in a controlled manner and only when necessary.
Since every such push creates a new build, too many triggers can overload
the Flathub build infrastructure.
:::

If your application is hosted in the Flathub GitHub organization, you can
use these actions, all others are not allowed:

1. Any action from the flathub organization
2. `peter-evans/create-pull-request` in any version
