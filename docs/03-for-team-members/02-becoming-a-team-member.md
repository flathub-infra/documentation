# Team members

Flathub, as a centralized repository of software apps, has a dedicated team of
contributors necessary to keep it running. These contributors are in charge of:

* Reviewing new applications
* Reviewing permission changes for existing aplications
* Reviewing existing applications on Flathub in case they need to adapt to
  modern guidelines

Consequently, they can be viewed as the auditors and moderators of our
community. As such, they play a big role in the decision-making process.
They are also an important part of the Flathub and Flatpak trust model. The fact
that applications' permissions are audited by the community helps to ensure
consistent and safe permissions across Flathub. Therefore, they also enjoy the
recognition for their work!

## Becoming a team member

We are always in need of more hands. If you want to be part of our team, help
out and enjoy the benefits, simply follow these steps:

* Engage with the community, so that other team members can know you.
* Help review [pending applications](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pulls)
  so that they match the
  [requirements](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/requirements).
  You don't need to be a team member to do so, more eyes are always welcomed,
  and that way you can prove your interest and ability to do the reviews.
  As with everything, there is always a learning curve, so the recommendation is
  to start small and listen to the feedback of existing team members.
  TODO: For how long should have people contributed? How many apps should they
  have reviewed?
* Review current apps to request and update permissions access.
  TODO: Is there a public place where this is done that people can contribute
  to? Or maybe just look at some existing apps?
* Open an issue in the [flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/) repo,
  listing your contributions and why you want you become a member.
  TODO: An issue template could help?
* You need at least 2 team members to endorse you becoming part of the team,
  so it is recommended that you have talked and collaborated with them before,
  so that they are aware of your work and the benefit of having you on board.

Please note that team membership is not a for-life benefit. In case of long
inactivity or conflict, the leadership retains the right to revoke permissions
without notice. If a team member wants to step down they can open an issue in
the [flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/) repo or can contact the
admins via [mail](mailto:admin@flathub.org) requesting so.
