Head over to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/flathub/distros/) to contribute or review translations in your own language. Approved translations will eventually show up on the [Set Up Flathub](https://flathub.org/setup) page on the website when someone selects their [corresponding language](https://flathub.org/languages).

Need help getting started with contributing translations? You can head over to our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.flathub.org/) or [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#flathub:matrix.org) for guidance.
