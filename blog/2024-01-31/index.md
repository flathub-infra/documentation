FOSDEM 2024—a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate—is this coming weekend in Brussels, Belgium and we'll be there! Learn where you can find us or even sit down and discuss Flathub itself, metadata and build validation, upcoming changes, and anything else on your mind.

## BoF: Saturday 16:00 CET

The [FOSDEM website] describes BoFs pretty well: 

>BOF stands for Birds Of a Feather who, as the saying goes, flock together. FOSDEM has three meeting rooms that may be booked in 30 or 60 minute blocks for discussions. All the meetings are public so anyone who is interested can attend if there is enough space. 

We've reserved a BoF room for **Saturday, February 3 at 16:00** local time (CET, UTC+1); seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, so arrive promptly! We'll be meeting to discuss recent developments around metadata and build validation, other upcoming changes, and anything else on the minds of the attendees. Check the [event] for the exact room details (and any scheduling changes).

We hope to see you there!
